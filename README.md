# Introduction
Get insights into the data job market. This project was aimed to learn how to write effienct queries by exploring different data analyst roles, top-paying jobs, in-demand skills and where demand meets high salary in data analaytics.

Check my SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
The main quest was understand which skills are necessary to learn to for landing a job in data analytics and which skills are the highest-paid

## These were the main questions answered in this analysis:
1. What are the top-paying jobs for data analysts?
2. What are the skills required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are the mosk in demand for data analysts?
4. What skills offer the highest salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
- **SQL**: The main languege used in order to order to query the database and answer the main questions
- **PostgreSQL**: This was the chosen database for this project in order to handle our dataset
- **VSCode**: My go-to IDE for executing SQL queries
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control, project tracking and sharing my analyssis
# The Analysis
Each query for this project was aimed to analyze specific aspects of data analyst job market:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst jobs
To identify top paying data analyst jobs, first I filtered my data to only show Data Analyst positiongs by averagy yearly salary. I filtered to show both on-site and remote schedule types and the location could be anywhere to get comparison from different countries.
```sql
SELECT
    job_postings.job_id,
    job_postings.job_title,
    job_postings.job_location,
    job_postings.job_schedule_type,
    job_postings.salary_year_avg,
    job_postings.job_posted_date,
    companies.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
LEFT JOIN 
    company_dim AS companies 
    ON job_postings.company_id = companies.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### 2. Top paying job skills
To answer what are the top paying job skills, I joined the job postings table with the skills data, providing insights into what skills employers value the most for high-paying roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_postings.job_id,
        job_postings.job_title,
        job_postings.salary_year_avg,
        companies.name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact AS job_postings
    LEFT JOIN 
        company_dim AS companies 
        ON job_postings.company_id = companies.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills  
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    top_paying_jobs.salary_year_avg DESC;
```
### 3. In-demand skills for Data Analytics
This query shows what skills are the most frequently requested in job postings, focusing on areas with high demand.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS skill_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    skill_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
### 4. Top paying skills based on salary
Explored average salaries based on different skills and revealed which skills are the highest paying
```sql 
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS average_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
### 5. Most optimal skills to learn
Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skill development.
```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS skill_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
), average_salary AS (
    SELECT
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS average_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    skill_count,
    average_salary
FROM 
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE
    skill_count > 25
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC,
    skill_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
